# Airgap.js UI utilities

Most of these utilities are ported from utilities using our native reference cache (NRC). If you need an NRC-using utility, it is suggested that you port it here rather than import it directly, as NRC is quite large and will unnecessarily bloat the UI without providing the intended security benefits.
